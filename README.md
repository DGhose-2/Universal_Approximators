Can an LSTM develop the right internal representation and correct predictions for sin(x)? Sure.

How about for y=sin<sup>3</sup>(x)+sin(x/2)? Again, yes--but this time at a computational cost: you'll need the right activation function, a wide and deep enough network, enough data to make tuning these hyperparameters feasible.
